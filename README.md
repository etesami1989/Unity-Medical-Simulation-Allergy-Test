# Allergy Skin Test Training Simulation (Unity-based)
Health Simulation Prototype | Birjand University of Medical Sciences (2022-Present) 

Project Overview
This project is a Unity (C#) simulation designed for medical students to practice allergy skin test procedures in a risk-free, virtual environment. The goal was to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and clinical practice using interactive scenario workflows.

### Key Responsibilities & Contributions 

Scenario Design: Developed structured workflows for the procedure, ensuring every step follows medical protocols.
* Data-Driven Evaluation: Collected and analyzed interaction metrics (time-to-complete, accuracy, user behavior patterns) to iterate on usability.
* System Reliability: Focused on building a trustworthy system where safety and user impact are prioritized.


### Research Integration This simulation was part of a larger research effort where I led a systematic review on AI-enhanced VR/AR medical simulators, emphasizing evaluation methodologies and threats to validity.

Tech Stack
